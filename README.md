# Drumming on Rails

###An awesome learning experiment. Trading Rails lessons for drum lessons weekly w/ [@gilesbowkett](https://github.com/gilesbowkett)

Our lesson plan? Short, disciplined practice each day. 

My routine:

 1. Writing specs against the [Ruby core library](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/)

 2. Solving small tasks (throwaway code)

 3. Watching a [Railscast](http://railscasts.com/) with breakfast

There is also a [specific Rails project](https://github.com/bomatson/startupsanonymous) associated with our learning process, but this repo represents the repetitive, daily process. This method has been set up so we can improve it week by week.
